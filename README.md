# node-react-todo
This is a very basic To-Do app written with a Node backend API and a React frontend.

### Install
```
git clone https://github.com/ironmysocks/node-react-starter
cd node-react-starter
npm install
cd client
npm install
```

### Start
Open two terminal windows. In the first window, do:
```
npm run server
```

In the second window, do:
```
npm run client
```

Then go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the app running.
